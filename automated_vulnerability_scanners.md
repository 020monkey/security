# Automated Vulnerability Scanners

Everyone on the interwebz that says they know something about pentesting will talk shit about nessus and say that it is for lazy pentesters, it creates too much noise, and that it produces too many false positives. That may be true, I don't know. But from a learning perspective it can be really creat. It can help to show you what kind of vulnerabilites are out there. So whatever, do what you want. 

## Server side scanning

### Nessus

Register and download it here.
http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-home

Then
```
dpkg -i nameOfFile
```

Start it
```
/etc/init.d/nessusd start
```

### Nmap Scripting Engine


Scripts are found on kali at:

```
/usr/share/nmap/scripts
```

```
nmap --script-help default
```

Or for a specific script:

```
nmap --script-help nameOfScript
```

Run all default scripts together with a port-scan. These scripts could possibily crash certain servers. Causing a denial-of-service. So never run this on production servers.
```
nmap -sC 192.168.1.101
```

Nmap has categoriesed their scripts into several different categories to make it easier to run a few of them together

```
uth
broadcast
default
discovery
dos
exploit
external
fuzzer
intrusive
malware
safe, 
version
vuln
```

So if you want to test all the vuln-scripts you do

```
nmap 192.168.1.10 -sC vuln
```

### OpenVas

OpenVas is another popular open-soruce vulnerability scanner. 

If you are on Kali linux you have to firt run the initial setup scripts, like this

```
openvas-setup
```

This will download some stuff and start setting everything up.

### Metasploit Scanner Module
