# Automated Vulnerability Scanners

Everyone on the interwebz that says they know something about pentesting will talk shit about nessus and say that it is for lazy pentesters, it creates too much noise, and that it produces too many false positives. That may be true, I don't know. But from a learning perspective it can be really creat. It can help to show you what kind of vulnerabilites are out there. So whatever, do what you want. 

## Server side scanning

### Nessus

Register and download it here.
http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-home

Then
```
dpkg -i nameOfFile
```

Start it
```
/etc/init.d/nessusd start
```

### Nmap Scripting Engine


Scripts are found on kali at:

```
/usr/share/nmap/scripts
```

```
nmap --script-help default
```

Or for a specific script:

```
nmap --script-help nameOfScript
```

Run all default scripts together with a port-scan. These scripts could possibily crash certain servers. Causing a denial-of-service. So never run this on production servers.
```
nmap -sC 192.168.1.101
```


### Metasploit Scanner Module


## Web Application Scanner

###  Nikto

```
nikto -h example.com
```

### Uniscan


```
uniscan -h 192.168.1.102
```
