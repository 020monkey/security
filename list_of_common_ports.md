# List of common ports

There are too many ports and services to write about all of them here. But still, I am going to try to write a bit about what I am learning.

## Port 22 - SSH

You can find out the version of the SSH either but scanning it with nmap or by connecting with it using `nc`

`nc 192.168.1.10 22`

It returnes something like this:
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu1

## Port 25 - SMTP

Port 25 can be used to enumerate users.

You can connect to port 25 by using nc. Like this:

It looks like this:

`$ nc 192.168.1.103 25                                                                                                                          130 â†µ
220 metasploitable.localdomain ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)
VRFY root
252 2.0.0 root
VRFY roooooot
550 5.1.1 <roooooot>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table`

Here we have managed to identify the user root. But roooooot was rejected.


VRFY, EXPN or RCPT command

## Port 993 - Imap Encrypted

The default port for the Imap-protocol.

## Port 995 - POP3 Encrypten

Port 995 is the default port for the *Post Office Protocol*. 
The protocol is used for clients to connect to the server and download their emails locally. 
You usually see this port open on mx-servers. Servers that are meant to send and recieve email.
