# Pivoting

Let's say that you have compromised one machine on a network and you want to keep going to another machine. You will use the first machine as a staging point/plant/foothold to break into machine 2. Thid technique of using one compromised machine to access another is called pivoting. Machine one is the `pivot` in the example. The `pivot` is just used as a way to channel/tunnel our attack.
