# Basics


## Exploits

An exploit is a module that has a payload.
An explout without a payload is a auxiliary module.


```
msfconsole
```

Exploits are graded from something to excellent. Exploits that are excellent should not crash the system you try to exploit.


You can either find modules right in metasplot, or on their website: http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules

### Msfcli
Msfcli has been deprecated and you should use the `-x`option in msfconsole instead.


### Msfconsole

Msfconsole is where we usually work. This is the most common metasploit interface.

### Update metasploit

```
msfupdate
```

### Search in metasploit

```
searchsploit
```
