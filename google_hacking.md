# Google hacking


## Google hacking
Google is a good tool to learn more about a website.

### Finding specific filetypes
```
filetype:pdf
```

### Search within webaddress
```
site:example.com myword
```

### Find in url

```
inurl:test.com
```

### Wild cards

You can use the asterisk to as a wildcard:
```
*
```
Example:
```
"I've been * for a heart"
```
This will return answers where * is anything.

## Exclude words
```
-
```
the dash excludes a specific word

This query searches for pages that used the word bananasplit. 
```
-banana bananasplit
```

### Cached version
So if a website has been taken down you can still find the cached version, of the last time google visited the site

```
cache:website.com
```
