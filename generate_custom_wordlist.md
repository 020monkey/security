# Generate custom wordlist

Cracking passwords is good to know.

If we are able to do a dictionary-attack against a service it is important that we use a good dictionary. We can use e generic one. But we can also generate a custom wordlist based on certain criteria. That is what we are going to do in this chapter.

## Who is the target?
The target might be a specific company or person.

## Password rules
The service you want to hack might have specific password rules. Must contain certain characters, must be of certain length etc.
