# OSCP

So part of the reason I have been working on this document/notepad/book is to prepare for the oscp exam.

Here are its guide-lines

## Highlights

### Exam Proofs: Linux



> On all Linux targets, you must have a root shell to receive full points. You must provide the contents of the proof files IN A SHELL (web, bind, reverse, or ssh) with the "cat" command from their original location. Obtaining the contents of the proof files in any other way will result in zero points for the target machine.
