# Outline of bugbounty/hacking/pentest

This is indended to work as a guide to doing bugbounties, hacking or pentest. Whatever you want to call it.


1. Find subdomains
The more subdomains you can find the bigger the attack surface is. And the more likely of success.
A. Resolve their IPs
Once you have a list of all subdomains you need resolve the IPs.

For specific guide in how to do this, see chapter Recon phase/active enumeration

2. Scan each machine
Now you have a list of IPs that belong to the target. Now we have to scan each machine thoroughly to see what services that machine is running, and if any of them are vulnerable.

3. Web-vulnerabilities
A. Identify input-areas. 
Check for:
SQL-injection
XSS
Text-injection
