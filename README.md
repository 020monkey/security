# Security

My notepad about stuff related to security. Stuff I have come across that I don't feel like googeling again.


This is constant work in progress. If you read about a vulnerability that you want to know more about I can really recommend searching for in on HackerOne via google. It is a good way to find real life examples of vulnerabilities.

Here is an example of such a search:
`site:hackerone.com sql-injection`
