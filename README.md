# Security

My notepad about stuff related to security. Stuff I have come across that I don't feel like googeling again.

This is constant work in progress. If you read about a vulnerability that you want to know more about I can really recommend searching for in on HackerOne via google. It is a good way to find real life examples of vulnerabilities.

Here is an example of such a search:
`site:hackerone.com sql-injection`

Sometimes the line isn't very clear between the chapters. Some actions might be considered part of the vulnerability analysis-phase, but it could also but considered part of the recon-phase. Whatever, it doesn't really matter. Pentesting isn't a science, it is a craft. It can only be learned by practice.


Most of the chapters here don't are written really sporadically with a lot of stuff missing. I just add stuff that I didn't know about before. So basically what is not in this book is everything I **don't** know about, and everything I at one point didn't know well enough.
