Enumeration

We can enumarate the system manually. Or using a script. This is a great script to use for internal enumeration.

https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum

Here are the options:

    -k Enter keyword
    -e Enter export location
    -t Include thorough (lengthy) tests
    -r Enter report name
    -h Displays this help text

If you are wondering how to get the script onto the machine, check out that chapter. https://bobloblaw.gitbooks.io/security/content/transfering_files.html
