# Basics of linux

This is a huge chapter. I could divide it up in many subchapters but I like to have it all at one place so I can just do `ctr-f`, and search for whatever I am looking for.

## The Shell - Bash

The shell, or the terminal is a really useful tool. Bash is the standard shell on most Linux distros.



### Navigating 

**pwd**

Print working directory

**cd**

Change directory

**ls**  
List files in directory

Sort list by time. -time -reverse

```bash
ls -ltr
```

**touch**

Create a new file.

**file**

Show info about file.

**cat**

Output content of file.

**less**

Output file but thest little bit at a time

**cp**

Copy

**mkdir**

Make directory.

To make an entire directory structure add the **-p** flag

```
mkdir -p new/thisonetoo/and/this/one
```

**rm**  
Remove file

Remmove recursivly and its content. Very dangerous command!

```
rm -rf ./directory
```

Watch the command destroy an enire machine: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4fzInlyYQo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4fzInlyYQo)

**rmdir**

Remove empty directory

**history**

Show commands history

**sudo**

List what rights the sudo user has.

```
sudo -l
```

Sudo config file is usually **/etc/sudoers**

## Finding files

There are mainly three ways to find files on linux. **Locate**, **find** and **which**.

### Locate

Locate is really fast because it relies on an internal database. So in order to have it updated you need to run:

```
updatedb
```

Then you can easily find stuff like this:

```
locate filename
```

### Which

Which searched the directories that are defined in your $PATH variable.

### Find

Find is slower but a lot more thorough. You can search for files recursively and with regex and a lot of other features.

```
# This will send all permissions denied outputs to dev/null.
find / -name file 2>/dev/null
```

## 2. Text-fu

* [https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/stderr-standard-error-redirect](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/stderr-standard-error-redirect)

### cut

This is a useful command to cut in text.

Let's say that we have the following text, and we want to cut out the ip-address.

```
64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=255 time=4.86 ms
```

```
cut -d" " -f4
```

`-d stands for delimiter. and -f for field.`

### sed - Stream editor

sed can perform basic editing on streams, that is to say, text.

Remove first line of file/stream

```
sed "1d"
```

### Show all lines just once

You have a list of passwords, or ip-addresses or whatever. And you want to remove all duplicates. How do you do it?

You have list:

```
aa
aa
bb
bb
cc
```

And you want to see:

```
aa
bb
cc
```

Command:

```
sort -u test.txt
sort test.txt | uniq
cat filename | sort -u > newFileName
```

### tr - translate

Transform all letter into capital letters

```
tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" < file1 > file2
```

Example  
Remove character

```
# Remove characters
cat file.txt | tr -d "."

# Remove and replace
# Remove all dots and replace them with underscore.
cat file.txt | tr "." "_"
```

[http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/12/linux-tr-command/](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/12/linux-tr-command/)

### AWK

So awk is an advanced tool for editing text-files. It is its own programming language to it can become quite complex. Awk iterates over the whole file line by line.

This is the basic structure of an awk command

```
awk '/search_pattern/ { action_to_take_on_matches; another_action; }' file_to_parse
```

The search pattern takes regex.  
You can exclude the search portion or the action portion.

This just prints every line of the file.

```
awk '{print}' filename
```

#### Filtering capabilites

Filtering out specific ip-address:

```
awk '/172.16.40.10.81/' error.log
```

Now we want to print out the fourth column of that file, we can just pipe this to cut, but we can also use awk for it, like this:

```
awk '/172.16.40.10.81/ {print $4}' error.log
# Another example
awk '{print $2,$5;}' error.txt
This prints columns 2 and 5.
```

#### Custom delimiter

We can use the -F flag to add a custom delimiter.

```
awk -F ':' '{print $1}' test.txt
```

#### BEGIN and END statements

So if you are manipulating some text you might want to start the output with some info about the columns or something like that. To do that we can use the BEGIN-keyword.

```
awk 'BEGIN {printf "IP-address \tPort\n"} /nop/ {print $3}' test.txt | head
awk 'BEGIN{printf "IP-address \tPort\n"} /nop/ {print $3} END {printf "End of the file\n"}' test.txt | tail
```

Here we are printing IP-address    PORT to the first line of the file.

## Vim

### Search

In command-mode:

```
/
```

### Show line-number

```
:set number
:set nonumber
```

### Go to line

```
:100G
:100gg
```

### To to last line

```
G
```

#### Add character to the beginning of each line

I have needed to do this several time when I write batch-scripts that I want to copy-paste into a windows-machine using echo. Instead of having to add a `echo on each line I want to do it all at onece.`

Here is how you do it

Use Ctrl + V to enter visual block mode.  
Move Up / Down to select the columns of text in the lines you want to comment.  
Then hit Shift + i and type the text you want to insert.  
Then hit Esc , wait 1 second and the inserted text will appear on every line.

## 4. User management

To add a user we write:

```
adduser NameOfUser

# On some machines it is
useradd nameOfUser
```

To add user to sudo-group

```
adduser NameOfUser sudo
```

On some machines we might not be able to edit the sudoers file because we don't have an interactive shell, in this case can you can just pipe in the text into the file, like this:

```
echo "username ALL=(ALL) ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```

Check which users are in the sudo group

```
cat /etc/group | grep sudo
```

Switch user in terminal

```
su NameOfUser
```

Remove/delete user

```
sudo userdel NameOfUser
```

## 5. Permissions

```
ls -la
```

Shows all the files and directories and their permission settings.

```
drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 4,0K ago  3 17:33 myfile
```

Here we have 10 letters in the beginning. The first one `d shows that it is a directory.    
The next three letters are rfor read, w for write and x for execute. The first three belong to the owner, the second three to the group, and the last three to all users.`

[https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/file-permissions](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/file-permissions)

## 6. Processes

A important job for a developer and sysadmin is to monitor process. A great way to do that is to use **htop** instead of **top**. The F1-10 keys might trigger OS-events. So you can use the shortcuts instead.

```
Shortcut Key    Function Key    Description
h                    F1           Invoke htop Help
S                    F2           Htop Setup Menu
/                    F3           Search for a Process
I                    F4           Invert Sort Order
t                    F5           Tree View
>                    F6           Sort by a column
[                    F7           Nice â€“ (change priority)
]                    F8           Nice + (change priority)
k                    F9           Kill a Process
q                    F10         Quit htop
```

## 7. Packages

## Organizing your $path variable

I am talking about debian/ubuntu here. On other systems I don't know.

You can define your path in `/etc/environment. If you don't have it you can create it and add the path like this:`

```
source /etc/environment && export PATH
```

If you are using zsh \(which you should\) you have to add it here

```
sudo vim /etc/zsh/zshenv
```

And add this line somewhere:

```
source /etc/environment
```

### Adding a path

This is a non-persistent way to add binaries to your path. Might be useful if you have entered a system that has limited binaries in the path.

```
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

### Install package

```
sudo apt-get install
```

If you only have a .deb file you do this to install from the terminal:

```
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file
```

```
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### Remove packages

This can be tricky. First find the package

```
dpkg --list
```

Then you find it in your list.

```
sudo apt-get --purge remove nameOfProgram
```

When you remove some package it might have requires some other dependencies. To remove those you run

```
sudo apt-get autoremove
```

### Installing custom packages

If you download a package that is not in the official repository you can put the binary in **/opt**. That is good place to put your binaries.

Now you need to add that path to your path-variable. Remember how we set that in **/etc/environment**. So now open up that file and add `/opt to it, so i looks like this.`

```
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/opt"
```

I always add custom binaries last. That means that if we have two binaries with the same name the machine will first select the original binary. This way you won't have to fear screwing up, by accidentally creating a new **ls** binary for example.

## 8. Cronjobs

There are two ways to configure cronjobs. The first one is by putting scripts in the following folders.

```
/etc/cron.daily
/etc/cron.hourly
/etc/cron.weekly
/etc/cron.monthly
```

The second way is to write the command in the crontab

```
# list cronjobs
crontab -l

# Edit or create new cronjobs
crontab -e
```

## 8. Devices

List all devices

```
fdisk -l
```

## 9. The Filesystem

#### Difference between sbin and bin

sbin is system binaries. A normal user do not have access to these binaries. It is only root and users with sudo privileges that do.

```
pelle@mymachine:/bin$ ls -la /bin
total 4092
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4096 2012-02-04 19:12 .

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   8796 2007-11-15 13:01 hostname
```

We have echo, cp, grep. The normal stuff a user needs.

In sbin we have binaries that control the system.

### Mount

So everything on the linux-filesystem belongs to some part of the filesystem-tree. So if we plug in some device we need to mount it to the filesystem. That pretty much means that we need to connect it to the filesystem. Mount is like another word for connect.

So if you want to connect a CD-rom or USB to your machine. You need to mount it to a specific path on the filesystem.

So if you plug in the usb it might be accessible at **/dev/usb**. But that it not enough for you to be able to browse the usb content. You need to mount it. You do this by writing

```
mount /dev/usb /media/usb
```

Or whereever you want to mount it.

So when you click on Eject or Safetly remove you are just unmounting.

```
umount /media/usb
```

Knowing how to mount and unmount might be useful if you want to get access to a remote NFS-directory. You will need to mount it to your filesystem to be able to browse it.

## Controlling services

### Systemctl

Systemctl can be used to enable and disable various services on your linux machine.  
Start ssh

```
systemctl start ssh
systemctl status ssh
systemctl stop ssh
```

You can verify that the service is listening for connection by running network status.

```
netstat -apnt
```

Make ssh start upon boot

```
systemctl enable ssh
systemctl enable apache2
```

### Init.d

Init.d is just a wrapper around Systemctl. I prefer it.

```
/etc/init.d/cron status
/etc/init.d/cron start
/etc/init.d/cron stop
```

### rcconf

This is a tool to control services more easily, what is running upon boot and so on.

## 10. Boot the system

## 11. Kernel

## 12. Init

## 13. Process utilization

## 14. Logging

## 15. network sharing

## 16. Network basics

### Netstat - Find outgoing and incoming connections

Netstat is a multiplatform tool. So it works on both mac, windows and linux.

```
$ netstat -antlp

```

A few interesting things to observe here is that my machine is using any port over 1024 to connect to the outside. So it is not like just because we communicate with https and connect to port 443 that we use that port on our machine. On our machine it can be any port \(over 1024\) and usually any port over 10000.

Find out what services are listening for connection on your machine  
Flags

```
-a # All
-n # show numeric addresses
-p # show port
-t # tcp
```

```
netstat -anpt
```

To easily check out what process is using lots of bandwidth you can use nethogs.

```
sudo apt-get install nethogs
nethogs
```

Or you can use tcpdump, or iptables.

Every listening process of course has a PID, but unless you are root you can't might not see them all.

### Firewall - Iptables

Iptables is a firewall tool in linux. A firewall is basically a tool that scans incoming and/or outgoing traffic. You can add rules to the iptables to filter for certain traffic.

#### Types of chains

So you can filter traffic in three different ways **input**, **forward**, and **output**. These are called three different chains.

**INPUT**  
This is for incoming connections. If someone wants to ssh into your machine. Or a web-server responds to your request.

**FORWARD**  
This chain is used for traffic that is not aimed at your machine. A router for example usually just passes information on. Most connections are just passing through. As you can see this will probably not be used so much on your machine, as a normal desktop or a server doesn't router that much traffic.

**OUTPUT**

This chain is used for outgoing traffic.

##### Active rules

To view your active rules you do

```
iptables -L
# It will output something like this

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
```

So as we can see the current policy is to accept all traffic in all directions.

If you for some reason has been tampering with the iptables and maybe fucked up. This is how you return it to the default setting, accepting all connections

```
iptables --policy INPUT ACCEPT
 iptables --policy OUTPUT ACCEPT
 iptables --policy FORWARD ACCEPT
```

If you instead want to forbid all traffic you do

```
iptables --policy INPUT DROP
 iptables --policy OUTPUT DROP
 iptables --policy FORWARD DROP
```

Okay, so let's block out some connections. To do that we want to add/append a new rule. We want to block all connections from our enemy 192.168.1.30.

```
# A for append, and S for source. 
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.30 -j DROP
# Block an entire range
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j DROP
```

Now if we want to see our current rules we just do

```
iptables -L
```

And we can now see our new rule.

To add line-numbers for each rule, so that you can then specify which rule you want to reset or change or something you can output the rluels with line-numbers

```
iptables -L -v --line-numbers
```

**Remove/delete a rule**  
To remove a rule you just do

```
# Remove one specific rule
iptables -D INPUT 2
# Remove all rules
iptables -F
```

**Save your changes**  
Your changes will only be saved and therefore in action until you restart iptables. So they will disappear every time you reboot unless you save the changes. To save the changes on ubuntu you do

```
sudo /sbin/iptables-save
```

#### Measuring bandwidth usage

There are a few different tools in hour arsenal that we can use to  measure bandwidth usage. We will start with iptables.

To view the input and output traffic we just list the rules with some verbosity.

```
iptables -L -v
# Stdout
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 6382 packets, 1900K bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 4266 packets, 578K bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
```

So clean this up and reset the count we can do the following

```
# Restar the count
iptables -Z
# Remove all the rules, FLUSH them
iptables -F
```

So now we just need to add our rules. A simple script for this would be

```
#!/bin/bash
iptables -F
iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -j ACCEPT
```

Then check out the traffc with

```
iptables -L -v --line-numbers
```

#### Examples

**Block outgoing connections to a specific ip**

```
iptables -A OUTPUT -d 198.23.253.22 -j DROP
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Have you tried turning it on and off?

I have had problems with the network-adapter not starting or something like that, on Ubuntu. You can try to restart the network manager if this happens:

```bash
sudo service network-manager restart
```

#### Magical rfkill

If for some reason the wifi is blocked you can unblock it \(or block it\) with rfkill.

```
$ rfkill list
0: phy0: Wireless LAN
    Soft blocked: no
    Hard blocked: no
2: hci0: Bluetooth
    Soft blocked: no
    Hard blocked: no
```

To block or unblock the **phy0** from the example above you do:

```
# Block
rfkill block 0
# Unblock
rfkill unblock 0
```

If there is a **hard block** it means that there is a physical switch on you machine that you need to switch off.
