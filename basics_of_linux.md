1. Basic commands
 - pwd
 - cd
 - ls
 - touch
 - file 
 - cat
 - less
 - cp
 - mkdir 
 - rm
 - rmdir
 - history
 - find
 This must be by far one of the most useful programs. But I tend to always forget how it works.
 
 A. Add binary to the path file
 Show the current path-variable
 `echo $PATH`
 
 Add new 
 
 2. Text-fu

### Show all lines just once
You have a list of passwords, or ip-addresses or whatever. And you want to remove all duplicates. How do you do it?


You have list:
```aa
aa
bb
bb
cc
```

And you want to see: 
```
aa
bb
cc
```

Command:

```
sort file | uniq
```

`cat filename | sort -u > newFileName`

## 4. User management

To add a user we write:
```
adduser NameOfUser
```

To add user to sudo-group
```
adduser NameOfUser sudo
```

Check which users are in the sudo group
```
cat /etc/group | grep sudo 
```

Switch user in terminal
```
su NameOfUser
```

Remove/delete user
```
sudo userdel NameOfUser
```

## 5. Permissions

 ### 6. Processes
 A important job for a developer and sysadmin is to monitor process. A great way to do that is to use `htop` instead of `top`. The F1-10 keys might trigger OS-events. So you can use the shortcuts instead.  

``` 
Shortcut Key	Function Key	Description
h	                F1       	Invoke htop Help
S	                F2       	Htop Setup Menu
/	                F3       	Search for a Process
I	                F4       	Invert Sort Order
t	                F5       	Tree View
>	                F6       	Sort by a column
[	                F7       	Nice â€“ (change priority)
]	                F8       	Nice + (change priority)
k	                F9       	Kill a Process
q	                F10     	Quit htop
 
 ```

## 7. Packages


### Install package
sudo apt-get install

If you onyl have a .deb file you do this to install form the terminal:
`sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file`

`sudo apt-get install -f`

### Remove packages
This can be tricky. First find the package
`dpkg --list`
Then you find it in your list.
`sudo apt-get --purge remove nameOfProgram`

When you remove some package it might have requires some other dependencies. To remove those you run
`sudo apt-get autoremove`
