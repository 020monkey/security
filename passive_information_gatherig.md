# Passive information gathering

It is passive in the meaning that it doesn't directly send packets to the service. But in any other sense of the word there is nothing passive about this phase.


 - Web information
Read through the website. What does it do.


 - Whois enumeration

Who is behind the website etc.
## Netcraft

Most of the info found on netcraft is not unique. It is basic whois info. But one thing is rally good, it lists the different IP-addresses the page has had over the years. This can be a good way to **bypass cloudflare** and other services that hide the real IP. Using netcraft we can find the IP that was in use before they implemented cloudflare.

Another detail that is good to know is the **hosting-company** or **domain-provider**. Those details can be used if we want to try some **social-engineering/spear-phishing attack**.
