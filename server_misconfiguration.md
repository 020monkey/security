# Server misconfiguration

## Webdav

Okay so webdav is old as hell, and not used very often. It is pretty much like ftp. But you go through http to access it. So if you have webdav installed on a xamp-server you can access it like this:

```
cadaver 192.168.1.101/webdav
```

Then sign in with username and pasword.
The default username and passwords are
Username: **wampp**
Password: **xampp**

Then use **put** and **get** to upload and download. With this you can of course upload a shell that gives you better access.
